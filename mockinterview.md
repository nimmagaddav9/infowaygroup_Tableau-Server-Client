# Mock Interview Q&A for Senior Lead Developer (React & Next.js)

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tell me about yourself and your relevant experience for this Senior Lead Developer role.

**Sample Answer:**

I have over 12 years of experience in frontend development, specializing in React and modern JavaScript frameworks. Over the past few years, I have led multiple projects involving React and Next.js for building scalable, performant web applications. I‚Äôve worked on both greenfield development and replatforming legacy apps into micro frontends deployed in cloud environments. In my previous roles, I‚Äôve led small to mid-sized frontend teams, mentored developers, established best practices in component design, state management, testing, and CI/CD pipelines. I‚Äôm very hands-on with coding, problem-solving, and architecture decisions while also ensuring team productivity and code quality.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is your experience with React? Can you explain some advanced concepts you‚Äôve worked with?

**Sample Answer:**

I‚Äôve extensively worked with React starting from class components to modern functional components with hooks. Some advanced concepts I‚Äôve implemented include:

- Custom Hooks for encapsulating reusable logic.
- Context API and Redux/Redux Toolkit for global state management.
- Code splitting and lazy loading to improve performance.
- Error boundaries for handling unexpected runtime errors.
- Implementing accessibility (WCAG compliance) and responsive design.
- Optimizing rendering performance using memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).

Additionally, I have led initiatives on component design systems ensuring reusability and consistency across the application.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain how you have used Next.js in your projects.

**Sample Answer:**

In my recent projects, I‚Äôve used Next.js for:

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to improve initial load times and SEO.
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for content-heavy pages that require periodic revalidation.
- API routes to build backend endpoints directly within Next.js.
- Image optimization using the built-in Next.js Image component.
- Implemented middleware for handling authentication and request pre-processing.
- Leveraging dynamic routing and catch-all routes for flexible page structures.

Next.js has been instrumental in building highly performant and SEO-friendly applications while simplifying deployment using Vercel or AWS.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is Micro Frontend architecture? Have you implemented it?

**Sample Answer:**

Micro Frontend is an architectural style where a frontend application is divided into loosely coupled, independently deployable modules, similar to microservices on the backend. I have implemented micro frontends using:

- Module Federation (Webpack 5) to share components across multiple frontend applications.
- Ensuring each team owns and deploys their module independently.
- Setting up shared libraries for design systems, authentication, and state management.
- Managing cross-application communication via custom events or shared global stores.
- Implemented micro frontend orchestration using single-spa in some projects.

This approach allowed multiple teams to develop, test, and deploy features autonomously, reducing dependencies and speeding up delivery.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you approach leadership as a Senior Lead Developer?

**Sample Answer:**

As a Senior Lead Developer, I focus on:

- Setting technical direction and architectural guidelines.
- Mentoring junior developers through code reviews and pair programming.
- Facilitating daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
- Ensuring code quality through automated testing, linting, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Promoting knowledge sharing sessions and fostering a collaborative team culture.
- Balancing hands-on coding with guiding the team and removing blockers.

I believe in leading by example ‚Äî writing clean, maintainable code while empowering my team members to grow and contribute actively.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ How do you ensure performance optimization in React/Next.js applications?

**Sample Answer:**

Some performance optimization techniques I apply include:

- Code splitting and lazy loading components.
- Memoizing expensive calculations with `useMemo` and preventing unnecessary renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback`.
- Utilizing SSR/ISR in Next.js for faster initial rendering.
- Image optimization using Next.js Image component.
- Pre-fetching routes using Next.js `Link` component.
- Optimizing API calls with debouncing and caching where possible.
- Profiling using React DevTools and Lighthouse for continuous performance monitoring.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Can you explain your experience with hands-on development?

**Sample Answer:**

I stay heavily involved in hands-on development. In my current role, I spend a significant portion of my time:

- Designing and coding critical modules.
- Writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Refactoring legacy code for better maintainability.
- Configuring build pipelines (Webpack, Vite, etc.).
- Implementing security best practices (XSS, CSRF prevention).
- Collaborating with backend teams on API design and integration.

This allows me to stay current with evolving technologies and better support my team technically.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ How do you manage state in large React applications?

**Sample Answer:**

Depending on the complexity:

- For local state: `useState`, `useReducer`, Context API.
- For global state: Redux Toolkit for scalable state management.
- For server-side state: React Query (Tanstack Query) for caching, background refreshes, and synchronization with server data.
- Leveraged middleware (Redux Saga, Thunk) for side effects when necessary.

I always aim for simplicity first, then scale the solution as the application grows.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ What challenges have you faced with micro frontends and how did you solve them?

**Sample Answer:**

- Versioning conflicts: Solved using shared libraries and strict dependency management.
- Consistent design system: Centralized component libraries.
- Cross-team coordination: Regular syncs, documentation, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Performance overhead: Optimized bundle sizes, lazy loading of federated modules.

By establishing clear contracts between micro frontends and setting architectural governance, we were able to build a stable system.

### üîü Do you have experience working onsite with cross-functional teams?

**Sample Answer:**

Yes, I have worked onsite in several roles where I closely collaborated with cross-functional teams ‚Äî including product managers, designers, backend developers, DevOps, and QA. Onsite collaboration often enhances communication, faster decision-making, and better alignment, especially for complex projects like micro frontends or full-stack feature deliveries.
